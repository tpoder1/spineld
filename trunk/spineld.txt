SYNOPIS
    spineld [OPTION] spinel [OPTION] [<item>]

DESCRIPTION
    This daemon allows load data from devices with spinel protocol
    support(http://www.papouch.com/shop/scripts/_spinel.asp). This protocol
    is supported by almost measure boards and other equipments produced by
    Papouch s.r.o. (http://www.papouch.com/en/). The daemon periodically
    gains data from configured sensors and provides output for other system.
    There also client interface which allows user to display data collected
    by the daemon. The system also provides interface to zabbix monitoring
    system.

OPTIONS
    spineld -u <user> -d <level>

       -u   - switch daemon to the <user> after start
       -d   - debug level; with the debug level > 0 the daemon will stay in foreground

    spinel [ -a o|s ] | [ <item> ]

       -ao   - display values of the all items defined in the config file
       -as   - display statistics regarding to the spinel devices

INETGRATION WITH ZABBIX MONITORING SYSTEM
    Zabbix (http://www.zabbix.com)) is huge monitoring system. Spineld have
    extensions which allows zabbix server to get data from the devices. For
    this purpose you can use spinel command. The follow example shows how to
    proceed to carry out integration with the zabbix system.

    1. Install the spineld package into your system. 2. Configure device in
    /etc/spineld.conf and run spinel daemon (/etc/init.d/spineld start) 3.
    Check if data are downloaded correctly (spinel -oa, spinel -os) 4. If
    the directory /etc/zabbix/externalscripts/ create link to spinel command
    (ln -s /usr/bin/spinel /etc/zabbix/externalscripts/spinel) 5. Connect
    into zabbix web interface and go to "Configuration" -> "Items" and
    create a new one. 6. Into the key item fill in the follow string:
    spinel[<item>] other items fill in as you need.

CONFIG FILE
    Spineld used the text based config file. Each line describes one
    measured value. As the parameter of the line device ip adders, spinel
    address and channel number are required. There are also possibility to
    have got a special values which are evaluated from the basic (source)
    values. For more detailed description of the config file, please see
    into distribution spineld.conf (/etc/spineld.conf) file.

    Examples of the lines in the config:

     source pwr_1         147.229.255.122:10001     0x1    1     x/300          # AC source 1
     source pwr_2         147.229.255.122:10001     0x1    2     x/300          # AC source 2

     expr  sum_1_2       %{pwr_1} + %{pwr_2}                                                                        # Sum
